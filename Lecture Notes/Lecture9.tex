\section{Multivariable Functions $-$ 14.1}

The domain of a multivariable function, $f(x,y)$, may be found by splitting parts of the function up.

\textit{Example:}

$$f(x,y)=\ln(9-x^2-9y^2)$$
$$D(f(x,y): 9-x^2-9y^2 \geq 0\Longrightarrow x^2+9y^2\leq 9 \Longrightarrow \frac{x^2}{9}+y^2\leq 1 $$

\end{document}
