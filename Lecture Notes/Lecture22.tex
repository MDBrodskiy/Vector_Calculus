\section{Green's Theorem $-$ 16.4}

For this theorem, let $C$ be a curve that is:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item positively oriented (moving counterclockwise)

  \item piecewise smooth

  \item simple

  \item closed

\end{enumerate}

$D$ is the region enclosed by the curve.

If $P$ and $Q$ have continuous first-order partial derivatives on $D$, then:

$$\int_C P\,dx+Q\,dy=\iint_D \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dA$$

For Green's Theorem, $D$ must have boundaries.

Notation (If $C$ is closed):

$$\int_C P\,dx+Q\,dy=\oint_C P\,dx+Q\,dy$$

If $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=1$, then Green's theorem yields the area of the region $D$:

$$\iint_D 1\,dA=A(D)$$
