\section{Arc Length and Curvature of Three Dimensional Functions $-$ 13.3}

As the arc length of a two dimensional function is defined by: $\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{f'(t)^2 + g'(t)^2} dt$, the arc length of a three dimensional function is defined by: $\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{f'(t)^2 + g'(t)^2 + h'(t)^2} dt$, or more simply: $\int_{a}^{b} |\overrightarrow{r}'(t)|dt$\\

The curvature, $\kappa$, of a vector function may be found using the formula: $\kappa(t)=\frac{|\overrightarrow{r}'(t)\text{ x } \overrightarrow{r}''(t)|}{|\overrightarrow{r}'(t)|^3}$
